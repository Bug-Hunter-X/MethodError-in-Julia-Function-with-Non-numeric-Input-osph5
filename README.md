This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia: a MethodError caused by unexpected input types in a function. The `myfunction` in `bug.jl` is designed to square the input, handling positive, zero, and negative numbers. However, if a non-numeric value is passed, it throws a MethodError because the `^` operator is not defined for all types.  The solution in `bugSolution.jl` enhances the function to check the input type and handle potential errors gracefully.
